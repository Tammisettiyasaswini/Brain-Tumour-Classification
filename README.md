# Brain-Tumour-Classification
This project classifies brain MRI scans into Brain Tumor or Healthy using deep learning. We implemented a custom CNN and compared it with InceptionV3, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Images were preprocessed and trained with transfer learning. ResNet gave the best accuracy, MobileNet was fastest, proving DLâ€™s power in medical imaging.
