# Brain-Tumour-Classification
This project classifies brain MRI scans into Brain Tumor or Healthy using deep learning. We implemented a custom CNN and compared it with InceptionV3, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Images were preprocessed and trained with transfer learning. ResNet gave the best accuracy, MobileNet was fastest, proving DLâ€™s power in medical imaging.
# Brain Tumor Classification ðŸ§   

This project builds a deep learning model to classify brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) from MRI scans using CNNs and transfer learning (InceptionV3/EfficientNet).  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
We used the *Brain Tumor MRI Dataset* available on Kaggle:
